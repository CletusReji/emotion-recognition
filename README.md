# EmoVision : Real-Time Emotion Detection Using CNNs

## Overview

EmoVision is a real-time emotion detection system that uses Computer Vision (OpenCV and MediaPipe) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER2013 dataset to classify human emotions with reasonable accuracy from facial expressions.

The system works on live webcam input and shows a bounding box around the detected face with the predominant emotion (calculated over a sliding window for stability), along with the confidence percentage. Users can also capture snapshots with predicted labels.

The core focus of our application is to showcase the capabilities of such a system in recognizing emotions. Through the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) dataset, with over 35000 labeled emotions across 6 emotion classes that include: Angry, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise and Neutral. Our model processes live camera feed as input and predicts the emotion in real time, that can enable itâ€™s application in various fields like mental health monitoring, user  experience analysis, human-computer interaction and intuitive gaming.

EmoVision aims to bridge the emotional gap between humans and machines by leveraging computer vision and deep learning, paving the way for more empathetic and responsive systems.
